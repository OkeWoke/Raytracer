# Raytracer

![Example image of raytraced sphere](https://github.com/OkeWoke/Raytracer/blob/light_fall_off/example_raytrace.png)

This is a raytracer I made over a couple of days, image saving done by png++, xml deserializing done by CMarkup

## Requirements
Needs CMarkup, zlib, libpng and then png++ to compile.
This is purely for image saving and xml deserialization.
